# Create scraper with ai

The idea of scraping a website with AI is to directly return the data we want in JSON format.

AI can help us by providing the class name of the data we need.

Why not always use AI to analyze the HTML?

This is because HTML files can be very large—often containing at least 500,000 to 600,000 characters—making it very expensive to process them with AI for every scrape.
